# Introduction

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Aetheris is in early development and is not yet ready for production use.
</Callout>

Aetheris is a framework for building backend API's with end to end type safety and a focus on developer experience.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Aether is to provide a simple solution to building APIs that are typesafe, and easy to understand. It's heavily inspired by <Link href="https://trpc.io/">TRPC</Link> and other similar solutions such
as <Link href="https://elysiajs.com/eden/">Eden</Link> or <Link href="https://hono.dev/guides/rpc">Hono RPC</Link>. If you are familiar
with these solutions and/or have tried them out, you'll find Aetheris to be quite similar.
