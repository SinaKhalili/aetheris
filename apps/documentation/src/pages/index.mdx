## Introduction

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Aether is in early development and is not yet ready for production use.
</Callout>

Aether is a straightforward way to build end-to-end typesafe APIs without relying on code generation, schemas, or contracts.

### Motivation

The motivation behind Aether is to provide a simple solution to building APIs that are typesafe, and easy to understand. It's heavily inspired by <Link href="https://trpc.io/">TRPC</Link> and other similar solutions such
as <Link href="https://elysiajs.com/eden/">Eden</Link> or <Link href="https://hono.dev/guides/rpc">Hono RPC</Link>. If you are familiar
with these solutions and/or have tried them out, you'll find Aether to be quite similar.

While using these solutions, I consistently found things I was searching for that existed in other solutions but not in the one I was using. Some pain points that Aether aims to solve are type inference
for websocket messages, and an easy way to build adapters for different frameworks.
