# Client

The Aetheris client library allows you to create the fully typesafe client for your Aetheris server. 

## Creating the client

Earlier in our [quick start guide](/guide/getting-started), we created a new Aetheris server and defined our application
router. We also exported a type that represents our router. This type can be used to create our client.

```ts filename="src/lib/api.ts" {0-2, 4-11} copy
import type { App } from "@/server";
import { createClient, httpLink } from "@aetheris/client";

export const api = createClient<App>({
    links:[
        httpLink({
            baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000/api",
        }),
    ],
});
```

With the client created, you can now import the `api` object and call your API routes. The client will automatically infer
any inputs or outputs from the api endpoints you created.

The createClient function also supports other transports such as websockets using `wsLink`.

```ts filename="src/lib/api.ts" {2, 4-11} copy
import type { App } from "@/server";
import { createClient, wsLink } from "@aetheris/client";

export const api = createClient<App>({
    links:[
        wsLink({
            baseUrl: "ws://localhost:3000",
        }),
    ],
});
```

For additional debugging, you can also add the `loggingLink` to your client. This will log the requests and responses to the console.
Links are called in order, so make sure the logging link is place before the transport link.

```ts filename="src/lib/api.ts" {2, 6} copy
import type { App } from "@/server";
import { createClient, wsLink, loggingLink } from "@aetheris/client";

export const api = createClient<App>({
    links:[
        loggingLink(),
        wsLink({
            baseUrl: "ws://localhost:3000",
        }),
    ],
});
```
