# Validation

You can validate procedure handler arguments by providing a validation schema to your procedure handler.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Currently only Zod schemas are supported for validation, but we plan to support other validation libraries in the future.
</Callout>

## Validating your handler

Earlier in our [quick start guide](/guide/getting-started), we created a new Aetheris server and defined a base router, but none
of our handlers take any input or have any validation. Let's expand on what we created so that we can validate the users input.

```ts filename="src/server/index.ts" {2, 8-13} copy
import { createAetheris, router } from "@aetheris/server";
import { z } from "zod";

const aether = createAetheris();

export const app = router({
    helloWorld: aether.handler({
        input: z.object({
            name: z.string(),
        }),
        resolve: async ({ input }) => {
            return `Hello, ${input}!`;
        },
    }),
});

export type App = typeof app;
```

The validation schema will now validate that the input object has a `name` property that is a string. If the input object does not
match the schema, the procedure will throw an error when resolving.

The type inference from our schema will carry over to our router type, allowing the client to know what the input object should look like.
Here is what our current router type looks like.

```ts filename="src/server/index.ts" copy
type Router = {
    helloWorld: Resolver<{
        input: {
            name: string;
        };
        output: {
            message: string;
        };
    }>;
}
```

Validation can also be used to validate the output of a procedure. By default the return type is inferred from the return value of the resolver, but
if you provide a `output` schema, the return value will be validated against the schema and the schema will be used instead of the inferred return
value.

```ts filename="src/server/index.ts" {7-10} copy
export const app = router({
    users: {
        getUser: aether.handler({
            input: z.object({
                id: z.string(),
            }),
            output: z.object({
                id: z.string(),
                name: z.string(),
            }),
            resolve: async ({ input }) => {
                return {
                    id: input.id,
                    name: "John Doe",
                };
            },
        }),
    },
}
```
