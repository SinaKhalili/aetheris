# Getting Started

Aetheris is split into two main packages: `@aetheris/server` and `@aetheris/client`. The server package is used to define your API
in the backend and the client package is used to call your API on the frontend. Depending on your project, you may want to install
these packages into their respective applications.

In this guide, we'll be focusing on the Next.js implementation which installs both packages in the same project.

    <Tab>
      ```bash 
      npm i @aetheris/server @aetheris/client
      ```

      ```bash 
      yarn add @aetheris/server @aetheris/client
      ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Quick Start

In an existing Next.js project, create a new file. This can be anywhere in your project, but for this example we will create a
new directory and create an `index.ts` file. In this file we will import `createAetheris` to create a new Aetheris server.

```ts filename="src/server/index.ts" {3} copy
import { createAetheris } from "@aetheris/server";

export const a = createAetheris();
```

This function returns an object containing two properties, `router` and `procedure`. These will be used to define your API. Let's 
begin with creating our base router.

```ts filename="src/server/index.ts" {5-7} copy
import { createAetheris } from "@aetheris/server";

const a = createAetheris();

export const router = a.router({});

export type Router = typeof router;
```

We also export the infered type of the router so that we can import it in the future to create our API client.

Next, we can create our first procedure. For now, we'll create a basic hello world procedure.

```ts filename="src/server/index.ts" {6-10} copy
import { createAetheris } from "@aetheris/server";

const a = createAetheris();

export const router = a.router({
    helloWorld: a.procedure.handler({
        resolve: async () => {
            return "Hello, World!";
        },
    }),
});

export type Router = typeof router;
```
